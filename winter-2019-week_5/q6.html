<!-- In the document there are 2 lists:

a list of To Do tasks (7 items)
a list of tasks already done (empty)
A task that has been already done is denoted by having the class done. So in the code, tasks 1, 2, 4 and 5 have been done.

Using JavaScript only find the list items of the tasks that have been done (i.e. have class done) and move them from the first list into the second. So after this operation the first list should have only 3 items and the second list should have 4 items. -->
